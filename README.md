Justice served with pure truth

An Open Source project aimed at finding injustice in justice. 

For the cost of computing plus running the business including paying professionals, administrators, and incentives to developers and participants, we can address corruption and fraud committed by those who are supposed to be protecting justice but are instead using inside knowledge to cheat and commit crimes.

System participants upload documents that they have the legal freedom to upload. The Ai then digests the documents and adds publicly available data to find probabilities. 

Remember coloration is not causation.
